        <h1>JavaScript Timing Events</h1>
        <br>
        <pre>JavaScript can be executed in time intervals. This is called timing events.

        <b>Timing Events</b>
        <br>
        <pre>
            The window.object allows execution of code at specified time intervals.

            These time intervals are called timing events.

            The two key methods to use with JavaScript are:
            <ul>
                <li><b>setTimeout(function, milliseconds)</b> - Executes a function, after waiting a specified number of milliseconds.</li>
                <li><b>setInterval(function,milliseconds)</b> - Sane as setTimeout(), but repeats the execution of the function continously.</li>
            </ul>
        </pre>

        The <b>setTimeout()</b> and <b>setInterval()</b> are both methods of the HTML DOM Window Object.
