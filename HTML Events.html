        An HTML Event can be something the browser does, or something a user clicks.

        Here are some examples of HTML Events: 

        <ul>
            <li>An HTML web page has finished loading.</li>
            <li>An HTML input field was changed.</li>
            <li>An HTML Button was clicked.</li>
        </ul>
    </pre>
    <br>
    <button onclick="this.innerHTML=Date()">Date</button>
    <br>
    
    </body>
</html>
