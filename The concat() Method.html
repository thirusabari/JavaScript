        <pre><b>concat()</b> joins two or more strings.
        The <b>concat()</b> method can be used instead of the plus operator. These two lines are the same.

        <h3>Note:</h3>

        <p>All String methods returns a new string. They don't modify the original string.

            Formally said, Strings are immutable; Strings cannot be changed, only replcaed.
